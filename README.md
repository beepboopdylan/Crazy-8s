# Crazy-8s
A modified, robot-space-invasion edition of the card game Crazy Eights, this project was for my school's Intro to CS course. Included is ASCII art, so if the robot is off centered, so sorry!

To play, first compile Game.java. Then, compile and run CrazyEights.java. Don't mess up. Humanity depends on it...
